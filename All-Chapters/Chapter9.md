# HTML Tables

In HTML, you can create tables to display tabular data on a web page. Below is an example of a simple table showing employee information:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Tables</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Employee Information</h1>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Department</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>101</td>
        <td>John Doe</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>Engineering</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>102</td>
        <td>Jane Smith</td>
        <td>28</td>
        <td>Marketing</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>103</td>
        <td>Michael Johnson</td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>Finance</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have created a simple table to display employee information with four columns: ID, Name, Age, and Department.

1. **`<table>`**: The main table element that wraps the entire table.

2. **`<thead>`**: The table header section that contains the header row (`<tr>`) with column headings.

3. **`<th>`**: The table header cell used for column headings. It is bold and centered by default.

4. **`<tbody>`**: The table body section that contains the data rows (`<tr>`) with table cells (`<td>`).

5. **`<td>`**: The table data cell used for regular data.

6. **Table Rows (`<tr>`)**: Each row in the table is represented by the `<tr>` element.

By default, tables in HTML have a border and certain spacing between cells. You can use CSS to style the table further, such as changing colors, fonts, borders, and padding.

Remember to add proper content to the table cells and adjust the number of rows and columns as needed for your specific use case. Tables are a powerful way to organize and display tabular data on a web page.
