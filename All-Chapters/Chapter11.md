# HTML Input Elements

In HTML, you can use various input elements to collect user data and interact with web forms. Here are some common HTML input elements:

## Text Input (`<input type="text">`)

Text inputs are used for single-line text entry. They are commonly used for names, email addresses, or short messages.

```html
<input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your username">
```

## Password Input (`<input type="password">`)

Password inputs are used for entering passwords. The entered text is typically masked for security reasons.

```html
<input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter your password">
```

## Textarea (`<textarea></textarea>`)

Textareas are used for multi-line text input, such as comments or longer messages.

```html
<textarea name="comments" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Enter your comments"></textarea>
```

## Radio Buttons (`<input type="radio">`)

Radio buttons are used when you want users to select a single option from a list of choices. All radio buttons within a group have the same `name` attribute but different `value` attributes.

```html
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female
```

## Checkboxes (`<input type="checkbox">`)

Checkboxes are used when you want users to select one or more options from a list of choices. Each checkbox has its own `name` and `value` attributes.

```html
<input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="reading"> Reading
<input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="traveling"> Traveling
```

## Select Dropdown (`<select></select>`)

Select elements create a dropdown menu for users to select a single option from a list.

```html
<select name="country">
  <option value="usa">USA</option>
  <option value="canada">Canada</option>
  <option value="uk">UK</option>
</select>
```

## File Input (`<input type="file">`)

File inputs are used for uploading files, such as images or documents.

```html
<input type="file" name="fileupload">
```

## Date Input (`<input type="date">`)

This input type allows users to select a date from a date picker.

```html
<input type="date" name="birthdate">
```

## Email Input (`<input type="email">`)

Used for collecting email addresses. It typically includes built-in validation for email format.

```html
<input type="email" name="useremail" placeholder="Enter your email">
```

## Number Input (`<input type="number">`)

This input type is used for numeric input and can include attributes like `min` and `max` to specify acceptable value ranges.

```html
<input type="number" name="quantity" min="1" max="10" value="1">
```

These are some of the most commonly used input types in HTML forms. Each type serves a specific purpose and can be customized with various attributes to meet your needs.
