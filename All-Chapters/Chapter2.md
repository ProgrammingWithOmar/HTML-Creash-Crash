# Chapter 2: HTML Elements:

## Basic HTML Elements:

   ### 1.Headings:

- ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>```
   
   Example:
  
  ```html
   
   <h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
   <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>


  ```

  ### 2.Paragraphs:

    - ```<p>```
    > The ```<p>``` tag is used to define paragraphs of text. It represents a block of text with a space before and after the content, making it visually distinct from other elements. Paragraphs are commonly used for regular text content on a web page.

    Example:

    ```html
      <p>This is a paragraph of text. It provides information and context for the web page.</p>
    ```

  ### 3.Span

    The ```<span>``` element is an inline-level container used to apply styles or manipulate a specific portion of text within a larger block of content. It does not add any structural meaning on its own but serves as a hook for applying styles or scripting.

    Example:

    ```html
      <p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word in a paragraph.</p>
    ```

    In this example, the word "red" will appear in red because of the <span> element with an inline style applied to it.‚òùüèæüëÜüèæ


    ### 4. Div:

    The ```<div>``` element is a block-level container used to group larger sections of content together. It is a versatile and generic element used for layout purposes and applies styles or scripts to multiple elements as a group.

    Example.

    ```html
    <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
    <h3>Section Title</h3>
   <p>This is some content within the div.</p>
     <p>Another paragraph within the div.</p>
       </div>
    ```


    ### 5.Small:

    The ```<small>``` element is used to represent small or fine print text within a larger block of content. It indicates text that is typically smaller than the surrounding text and often used for disclaimers, copyright notices, or annotations.

    Example:

    ```html
    <p>This is a paragraph of regular text. <small>This is a small note.</small></p>
    ```

    In this example, the text within the ```<small>``` element appears smaller than the rest of the paragraph text, indicating a small note or additional information.

   It's important to note that the ```<small>``` element is primarily a presentational element, and using it to make text smaller for visual purposes should be done with caution. For adding semantic meaning to text, consider using other appropriate elements like ```<em>```, ```<strong>```, or creating your custom CSS styles.

   Here's an example of how you might use the ```<small>``` element for additional information within a paragraph:



   ```html
    <p>
    HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a page.
