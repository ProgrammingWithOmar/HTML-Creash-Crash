# Chapter 5: Text Formatting 

### Text Formatting 

1. **Headings:**
   Use heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create headings of different levels. They indicate the hierarchy and structure of the content.

   ```html
   <h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
   <h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
   <h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
   ```

2. **Paragraphs:**
   Use the `<p>` element to create paragraphs of text.

   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
   ```

3. **Text Formatting:**
   Use the following elements for text formatting:
   - Bold: `<strong>` or `<b>`
   - Italic: `<em>` or `<i>`
   - Underline: `<u>`
   - Strikethrough: `<s>` or `<del>`
   - Superscript: `<sup>`
   - Subscript: `<sub>`

   ```html
   <p>This is <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text. <u>Underline</u> and <s>strikethrough</s> are also supported.</p>
   <p>This is a mathematical equation: E=mc<sup>2</sup>. Also, H<sub>2</sub>O is water.</p>
   ```

4. **Abbreviations and Acronyms:**
   Use the `<abbr>` element to define abbreviations and acronyms. The `title` attribute provides the full expansion.

   ```html
   <p><abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> is widely used.</p>
   ```

5. **Quotations:**
   Use the `<blockquote>` element for longer quotations and the `<q>` element for shorter inline quotations.

   ```html
   <blockquote>
     <p>This is a longer quotation that spans multiple lines.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>He said, <q>This is an inline quotation.</q></p>
   ```

6. **Citations:**
   Use the `<cite>` element to mark citations, such as titles of books, articles, or works.

   ```html
   <p><cite>The Catcher in the Rye</cite> is a famous novel.</p>
   ```

7. **Emphasis and Strong Emphasis:**
   Use the `<em>` element for emphasis and the `<strong>` element for stronger emphasis.

   ```html
   <p>This is <em>important</em>. This is <strong>very important</strong>.</p>
   ```

8. **Marked or Highlighted Text:**
   Use the `<mark>` element to highlight or mark text.

   ```html
   <p>This text should be <mark>highlighted</mark>.</p>
   ```

9. **Inline Code:**
   Use the `<code>` element to indicate inline code or computer code.

   ```html
   <p>This is an example of <code>inline code</code> in HTML.</p>
   ```

10. **Line Breaks:**
    Use the `<br>` element for line breaks.

    ```html
    <p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>
    ```

11. **Horizontal Rule:**
    Use the `<hr>` element to insert a horizontal rule or divider.

    ```html
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is another paragraph of text.</p>
    ```

By using these HTML elements and attributes, you can format your text and add semantic meaning to your content, making it more readable, accessible, and structured. Properly formatted text enhances the user experience and improves the overall quality of your web page.
